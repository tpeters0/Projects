## Rubric results

Software Production: 1
- program is functional *i think haven't actually run it just based on looking at the code thus far* with no major erros.
- To achieve a 2 in this category you could incorporate multiple users into the functionality. Or you could create an answer model any time a person answers a question. I think you're pretty close though. I like what i see of your solution. Maybe instead of referencing an Ocean in your seed file you could have the user be able to create multiple battleship games.

Code Quality: 1
- overall code quality is good
- see comments for refactoring opportunities
- to achieve a 2 in this category you would want to almost all logic into ruby class definitions. Again I think you're pretty close on this one as well.

Associations: 2
- you had multiple associations and implemented them in your application. I think it'd be awesome if you created a User model that could have many ocean_grids.

Tests: 1
- you have a test! excellent
- to achieve a 2 in this category you would want to actually test the code that applies to your program. Testing models/attributes/methods.
Docs: 1
- has an ERD that establishes attributes and relationships
- hash our stuff on user stories.
- I really want to give you a two cause you have great docs. But you need to include setup instructions for your program in order to achieve a 2.
