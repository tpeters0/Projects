Title: Sink, Sank, Sunk

Variation of a 'Battleship' style game where user uses the command line interface to send missiles to certain ocean grid coordinates hoping to hit an enemy ship.

There are two hidden ships, both 5 segments (rows or columns) long.  When all 5 segments of a ship have been 'hit,' the ship is sunk.  When both ships are sunken, the player wins.
