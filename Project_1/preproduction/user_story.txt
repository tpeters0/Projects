As a game player,
in order to sink ships to win,
I want to enter grid coordinates to 'torpedo' and mark the spot as either a hit, if there is a ship at that coordinate,
or miss if there is no ship.

# user stories should break down problems.
# Ex. - A user should be able to enter grid coordinates
# Ex. - A user should be able to fire a torpedo
# Ex. - A user should be able to hit a ship.
