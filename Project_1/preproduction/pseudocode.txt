- create ocean/grid
    - make hash with
    -column lables: 1 array with string of incremental numbers, 1 -10
    - 10 row arrays named A to J with 1 value of corresponding letter (row labels), 10 values of " ~ ", and one value "|"

        - puts(column_head_array)
        - puts(Array_A.join(" | "))
        - puts("----------------")
        - puts(Array_B.join(" | "))
        - puts("----------------")

        ... thru

        - puts(Array_J.join(" | ")
        - puts("----------------")

- assign coordinates to equal parts of ship
  - create ship class with two instances
  - have second player enter values for ships?
      or
        - random select row and index, and incremental or decremental for 4 array indexes
          or
        - random select row and index, match index number of 4 consecutive arrays

  -  Boolean value for whether ship is there or not
      - default is no ship = false
      - otherwise ship = true

- Methods for playing game
  - Get user input - row A - J, column 1-10
  - Using that input, evaluate whether there is a ship there or not
        - access the hash with appropriate array and index
        - determine if true or false for ship

  - Results from determination of whether ship or not
      - If true
          - puts("It's a hit!")
          - change " ~ " in appropriate array index to " * " for display in grid
      - If false
          - puts("Sorry.  That's a miss!")
          - change " ~ " in appropriate array index to " o " for display in grid

  - If all 5 spots of ship model are hit
        - puts "You sunk it!"
        - add to user score

      - when both are sunk
        - puts "You win!!!"

- Additional methods needed
  - quit
  - clear board
  - view score
  - view number of turns taken
